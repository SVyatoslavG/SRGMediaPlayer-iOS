 *  apperance (AirPlay icon with text displaying the route) will be used, which can be further customized through 
 *  the `SRGAirPlayViewDelegate` protocol.
 *
 *  A media player controller can be optionally attached. If AirPlay playback mirroring is used (the `AVPlayer`
 *  `usesExternalPlaybackWhileExternalScreenIsActive` property has been set to `NO`), no overlay will be displayed.
 *  No overlay will be displayed if only audio is sent to a device supporting only audio casting (e.g. Airport express).
 *
 *  If no media player controller is attached, the overlay will be displayed for any kind of AirPlay usage.
 *
 *  Further customization is available by using the associated delegate.
